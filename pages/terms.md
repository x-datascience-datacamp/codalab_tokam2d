Participants may compete individually, subject to the rules specified by the course instructors.

## 2. Data Usage

The datasets provided for this challenge (including but not limited to *blob_i*, *blob_dwi*, *turb_i*, and *turb_dwi*) are intended **solely for educational and research purposes** within the scope of this course.

Participants agree to:
- Use the data only for the purpose of this challenge.
- Not redistribute the data outside the course or upload it to public repositories.
- Not attempt to identify, reverse-engineer, or misuse the data beyond its intended scientific context.

- The dataset *turb_dwi* is reserved for evaluation only and must not be used in the training loop.
- Any attempt to directly or indirectly train on the evaluation data will result in penalties or disqualification.

## 4. Submission Rules

Participants must submit:
- A compressed folder containing the code necessary to train a model (see page `seed.md`).
- Any accompanying code or documentation as specified by the instructors.

Submissions must be the original work of the participants.
